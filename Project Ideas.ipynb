    "###Especially for short-term and vacation rentals, scammers are abundant. Identify likely candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scraping a large number of Craigslist sublet and vacation rental ads.\n",
    "* (Almost certainly) identifying a large number of scam ads for a training set.\n",
    "* Most reliable method for obtaining training set: automated e-mails, identifying scammers as those who disappear once mention of \"verifiable transfer of money & key phrase\" is used.\n",
    "* NLP, classifier and/or similarity methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very nice to have.\n",
    "* Could be used to identify interesting aspects of scams, frequently-used e-mails, etc.\n",
    "* Success may attract attention (good and bad).\n",
    "* For some scams, could identify as such by extracting address information and searching web / Trulia for alternate listing info. If listed as for sale, probably a scam. If listed for a higher rate on property management site, probably a scam.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To identify 100s/1000s of classified scams, would need to ask (using automation) 1000s of *legitimate* ad posters to respond. That amounts to asking for 100s of hours of free effort.\n",
    "* To distinguish between ads no longer active and actual scams, would need a round of back and forth before the question about verifiable transactions. This might require significant NLP. (But maybe not.)"

    "\n",
    "* Geolocation a likely barrier. Alternative would be twitter, for the fraction of users with GPS enabled.\n",

    "* If reliant on twitter, sentiment analysis 300 $\\times$ harder.\n",
