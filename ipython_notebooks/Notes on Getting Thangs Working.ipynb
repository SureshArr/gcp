    "To use AWS you will need to set up a public/private key. There are two things to keep track of:\n",
    "* the <code>.pem</code> file containing an encryption key used when shelling in to AWS;\n",
    "* the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY that are provided when setting up security.\n",

    "### Caffe on AWS g2.2xlarge instance\n",
    "\n",
    "A GPU-enabled AWS instance is a requirement for Caffe, if speed is important. Since my application allows users to supply images interactively, I've gone that route.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Two posts are especially useful for getting Caffe working on Fedora, and working on AWS:\n",
    "* [Thoughts on Cognition: Caffe on AWS with Fedora 20, CUDA 6.5 and CUDNN](http://cjbeyer.blogspot.com/2014/10/caffe-on-aws-with-fedora-20-cuda-65-and.html \"A blog posting by Charles Beyer\")\n",
    "* [Caffe on EC2 Ubuntu 14.04 Cuda 7](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Caffe-on-EC2-Ubuntu-14.04-Cuda-7 \"Caffe's own Ubuntu AMI\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these gives clear guidance on how to build Caffe on a Fedora-based system (what I have on my notebook). The only thing missing is that neither the Caffe installation documentation, nor this blog post, explicitly tell of the need to install <code>openblas-devel</code> if using <code>openblas</code>. The error messages that result when that is missing did not give me *the slightest indication* of the true nature of the problem.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "I was able to use the pre-built AMI from Caffe without trouble. Note that the username for an Ubuntu instance is <code>ubuntu</code>, rather than <code>user</code>. (This is relevant for using <code>ssh/scp</code> &mdash; see above.)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "#### <a name=\"Xvfb\">Xvfb</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Running my app requires X, which is problematic when logging out of the AWS instance. <code>Xvfb</code> is the fix. While logged onto AWS, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "apt-get install xorg-x11-server-Xvfb\n",
    "Xvfb :100 -ac\n",

    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "[See Running X applications headless using Xvfb](http://blog.kagesenshi.org/2007/06/running-x-applications-headless-using.html \"a blog entry by Izhar Firdaus\") for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### tmux\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent the application from quitting when logging off of the AWS instance, it is neccesary to run it in background <code>&lt;ctrl-b&gt;</code> and detach it <code>&lt;D&gt;</code>. This can be done with <code>tmux</code>:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "tmux new -s Flask\n",
    "sudo python app/my_app.py\n",
    "&lt;ctrl-b&gt;\n",
    "&lt;D&gt;\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify a running process:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "tmux ls\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "To be tested:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "On a local machine, if <code>flask</code> application code is modified, the application automatically reloads the software to affect the change.\n",
    "It may work on AWS to re-attach to <code>tmux</code>, insert new code, and then detach again.\n",
    "Supposing that the new version of the code is sitting in <code>~/</code>, while the application resides in <code>app/</code>.\n",
    "Try something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "tmux attach -t Flask\n",
