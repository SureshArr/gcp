   "Which of These Does Not Belong? Anomaly Detection in Images Using a Deep
   Neural Network and Isolation Forest"

   [Which of these does not belong image from Sesame Street]

1. Motivation:

     "...  as we know, there are known knowns; ... things we know we know.
     We also know there are known unknowns; ... we know there are some things
     we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns ~ the ones we don't
     know we don't know."
					Donald Rumsfeld, 12 February 2002 

   o Much anomaly/fraud detection done using classifiers

     + Use existing data sets, label anomalies (fraud, network intrusions, etc.)
     + Build classifiers to look for more anomalous cases
     + Problem: this works for finding 'anomalies' we know about

     + Alternatives exist, such as assuming that good data fit into a
       multi-variate Gaussian distribution, and that points in the tail can
       be treated as anomalies.
       ---> Can fail when 'ordinary' data fall into well-separated clusters.

2. Solution:

   o Isolation Forest
     + Un-supervised method of statistically isolating points that have no
       close neighbors
     + Great advantage that there is no need to compute O(n!) distances to find
        which points are distant from all others.

3. When data is in the form of images

   o Can work with raw pixels, but
     + The same images translated by a handful of pixels can occupy rather
       distinct locations in p-dimensional space.
     + Should take advantages of excellent work done in image feature
       representation -- deep neural nets
     + Simple, but for most cases too simple-minded

4. 'Featurize' the images before processing

   o Introduce readily-available pre-trained [name of network]
     + Feed images from data set in
     + extract the 1000 or 4096 high-level features
     + apply Isolation Forest
     + determine anomaly score threshold that either
        a) represents significance; or
        b) which can afford to examine with greater scrutiny.

5. Sample results

   Golden Gate bridge photos amoung thousands of lunar images.
   Horses amoung many cats.

6. Other applications

   o The main thing: find a feature representation that will place things of
     interest in distinct locations in p-space.

     + Audio: borrow from approach used by John Woodard to represent sound clips
       by Fourier (or Wavelet) transforms. Flag those spectra that are distinct.
